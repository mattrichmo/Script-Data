# Script-Data

This is a dataset of movie scripts in Markdown format, along with YAML metadata. The goal of this project is to catalog every movie script in a single file.

## Dataset Structure

Each movie script is stored in a separate Markdown file but will eventually be converted into a single JSONL file. 

Questions to ponder: 

- is there an identifier for quality, or at least an easy identifier for shit?
  - Possible identifiers: 
    - Budget?
    - Awards?
    - Studio?
- How to determine each level of the script using screen JSON format?
