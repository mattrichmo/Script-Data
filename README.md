# Script-Data

This is a dataset of movie scripts in Markdown format, along with YAML metadata. The goal of this project is to catalog every movie script in a single file.

## Dataset Structure

Each movie script is stored in a separate Markdown file but will eventually be converted into a single JSONL file.
